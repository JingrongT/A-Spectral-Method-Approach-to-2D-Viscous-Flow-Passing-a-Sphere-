Within this project, we explore variants of spectral method and simulate a variety of fluid dynamics phenomena, ranging from the 2D flow around a sphere, which entitles the project, to Kelvin$-$Helmholtz instability. In particular, we offer two extensions of the classical pseudo-spectral method, which we term the "damping" and "pushing" methods, that approximate the viscous flow passing obstacles. Future works will target at the theoretical and technical specifics of the methods we offer, such as the convergence and robustness of our approximation, the effect of obstacle with irregular geometry, and generalization of our methods to 3D.
